This Flutter application allows users to share and discover recipes for a variety of dishes. It utilizes the Provider package for efficient state management and Firebase for authorization and data storage, providing a seamless experience for users to explore and contribute recipes.

## Features
The E-commerce Flutter application offers the following features:

The app provides a user-friendly feature for effortless recipe editing. Users can easily update ingredients, cooking instructions, and other details of their shared recipes. All changes are seamlessly synchronized with Firebase, ensuring real-time updates for other users.

#### Filter Options: 
Users can discover dishes based on specific properties using the app's filter options. This enhances the recipe exploration experience by allowing users to easily find recipes that match their preferences, such as vegetarian or non-vegetarian dishes. 

#### Favorites Curation:
