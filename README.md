# The Yummies - FLutter APP

Welcome to The Yummies App!

This app allows you to browse a variety 
of delicious meals and save your favorites 
for easy access later.

On clicking the image of any meal you are navigated to a new screen which displays the recipe of the Meal.

If you come across a recipe that you particularly enjoy, you can add it 
to your favorites section by clicking  the "Heart" button on footer part of the 
image of the particular meal.The Favorite Dishes can then be accessed 
by selecting the "Favorites" option from the PopUpMenuOption.

On clicking the Drawer icon ,you can select the editMealsScreen to know all your meals in a screen using ListTile.
The delete icon,on clicking deletes the Meal Completely.

Adding a new Meal Recipie :
On clicking the plus button a new screen is opened which has a form to fill the details about the meal like recipie , cost , time , vegetarian or not etc..
For now, I am using Image.network to show the image.

The Hive Integration with the App is done and all the dishes recipies are saved locally.
